# Machine-Predictive-Maintenance-Classification Exercide

This repository contains the code and documentation for a multi-class classification task using the given dataset. 

The goal is to predict machine failure based on a set of features.

# Dataset

The dataset used for this task is available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/machine-predictive-maintenance-classification. 

# Preprocessing

Before training the model, the dataset needs to be preprocessed. This involves cleaning the data and performing standardization/normalization. The preprocessing techniques used will be implemented in the code.


# Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques will be applied to gain insights into the dataset and visualize the data. This will help in understanding the distribution of the features and identifying any patterns or anomalies present in the data.
Pretty much the following methods are used:
-info()
-describe()
-head()
-tail()
and other figure librarie were called, techniques used will be implemented in the code.

# Data Augmentation

Skipped but could be done using the Amote library or others...

# Deep Neural Network Architecture

A deep neural network architecture will be established using the PyTorch library to handle the multi-class classification task. The architecture will be designed to effectively learn and classify the given dataset.
Techniques used will be implemented in the code.

# Hyperparameter Tuning

The GridSearch tool from the sklearn library will be used to find the best hyperparameters for the model. This includes tuning parameters such as the learning rate, optimizers, number of epochs, and model architecture. The goal is to find the combination of hyperparameters that results in the most efficient model.Techniques used will be implemented in the code.

# Training and Evaluation
The model will be trained using the training data and evaluated using both the training and test datasets. During training, the loss and accuracy will be monitored and recorded for each epoch. These metrics will be visualized using graphs to track the model's performance over time.

# Performance Metrics
Metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, and F1 score will be calculated on both the training and test datasets. These metrics will provide insights into the model's performance and its ability to classify the different classes accurately.

# Regularization Techniques
Several regularization techniques will be applied to the deep neural network architecture to improve the model's performance and prevent overfitting. The performance of the regularized model will be compared with the initial model to assess the impact of regularization.
